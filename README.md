SQL
This repository contains a set of SQL queries for a blog site database. These queries are designed to retrieve valuable information from the database related to blog posts, users, categories, and comments. Each query is explained below:

1. **Retrieve all blog posts with their titles, authors, and categories:**
   This query fetches data from the "posts" table along with the corresponding "users" and "categories" tables to display the titles of blog posts, the usernames of their authors, and the names of the associated categories.

2. **Get the 5 most recent blog posts along with their titles, authors, and publication dates:**
   Using this query, the code retrieves the most recent blog posts by sorting them based on their creation dates in descending order and then limits the result to the top 5. It displays the titles of these blog posts, along with the usernames of their authors and the publication dates.

3. **Display the number of comments for each blog post:**
   In this query, data from the "comments" table is grouped based on the related blog post's title. It counts the number of comments for each blog post and displays the post title along with its comment count.

4. **Show the usernames and email addresses of all registered users:**
   The code fetches the usernames and email addresses of all users from the "users" table.

5. **Retrieve the latest 10 comments along with their respective post titles:**
   This query retrieves the 10 most recent comments from the "comments" table, along with the titles of the blog posts to which each comment belongs. The comments are sorted based on their creation dates in descending order.
